# battleChip

BattleChip was a team project made on week 4 of the Code Academy bootcamp - an educational game whose main characters are two chips battling against each other, as if they were electric shock-throwing tanks, in order to teach kids about basic computer science concepts. This project is the first level of a game intended to make its users climb the abstraction ladder and garner knowledge in the process!


# development process

This project was done by 5 people, part-time, during a week's-worth of work, and we started off with a blank canvas: there were no limitations to our creativity other than the deadline, so the team decided to make a protorype for a two-player videogame, dividing the team between lead programmers, lead designers, content creators and marketing. 

The technologies we used were mainly Java programming language, suported by two libraries to handle sound and the graphical interface.
